    <Paragraph>
      Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and
      transparent record-keeping. Blockchain technology has revolutionized industries such as
      finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. As a developer, you can build decentralized
      applications (dApps) using blockchain technology.

    <SectionTitle>Blockchain Basics</SectionTitle>

    <Paragraph>
      Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and
      transparent record-keeping. Blockchain technology is based on the concept of blocks, which are
      records of transactions that are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a hash of the
      previous block, which creates a tamper-evident record of all transactions.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      There are two types of blockchain networks: public and private. Public blockchains, such as
      Bitcoin and Ethereum, are open to anyone and are secured by a consensus mechanism. Private
      blockchains, on the other hand, are restricted to a group of users and are secured by
      permissioned access.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>Smart Contracts</SectionTitle>

    <Paragraph>
      Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are stored on a blockchain. Smart contracts
      are written in a programming language such as Solidity and can automate the execution of
      contract terms. Smart contracts can be used to automate processes such as payments, asset
      transfers, and voting.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>Consensus Mechanisms</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Consensus mechanisms are used to ensure that transactions on a blockchain network are valid
      and secure. There are several types of consensus mechanisms, including:
