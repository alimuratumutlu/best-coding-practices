    <Paragraph>
      Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative
      development, frequent releases, and customer involvement. It was created in the late 1990s as
      a response to traditional software development methodologies that were often slow and
      inflexible. XP is based on a set of values and practices that prioritize customer
      satisfaction, communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. In this article, we&apos;ll
      discuss the key components of XP, its benefits and drawbacks, and its applications. It
      emphasizes communication, feedback, and simplicity, and it is based on a set of values and
      practices that prioritize customer satisfaction and continuous improvement. Here are the key
      components of XP:
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>1. Planning Game</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The planning game is a collaborative process that involves the customer and the development
      team. During the planning game, the customer identifies the requirements for the software, and
      the development team estimates the time and resources required to complete each requirement.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>2. Small Releases</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      XP emphasizes frequent releases of small, working increments of the software. This approach
      helps to ensure that the software meets the needs of the customer and allows for early
      identification and correction of any issues.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      TDD is a software development practice that involves writing automated tests before writing
      the code. This approach helps to ensure that the code meets the requirements and that any
      issues are identified and addressed early in the development process.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>4. Continuous Integration</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Continuous integration is a software development practice that involves regularly integrating
      and testing the code. This approach helps to ensure that the code is functioning correctly and
      that any issues are identified and addressed early in the development process.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>5. Pair Programming</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Pair programming is a software development practice that involves two programmers working
      together at one computer. This approach helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and
      that any issues are identified and addressed early in the development process.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>6. Refactoring</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Refactoring is the process of improving the quality of the code without changing its
      functionality. XP emphasizes regular refactoring to ensure that the code is maintainable and
      scalable.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>7. Continuous Feedback</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      XP emphasizes continuous feedback from the customer and the development team. This feedback
      helps to ensure that the software meets the needs of the customer and that any issues are
      identified and addressed early in the development process.
