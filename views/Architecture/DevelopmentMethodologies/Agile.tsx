    <Paragraph>
      Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration,
      flexibility, and iterative development. The Agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto,
      a set of values and principles for software development that prioritizes individuals and
      interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. In this
      article, we&apos;ll discuss the key principles and practices of Agile development, its
      benefits, and its applications. Here are the key principles and practices of Agile
      development:
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>1. Collaboration</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Agile development emphasizes collaboration between the development team, the customer, and
      other stakeholders. This collaboration helps to ensure that the software meets the needs of
      the customer.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>2. Flexibility</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Agile development is highly flexible and adaptive. It allows for changes to be made throughout
      the development process, which means that the software can evolve to meet changing
      requirements.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>3. Iterative Development</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Agile development is based on iterative development, which means that the software is
      developed in small, incremental stages. Each stage builds on the previous stage, and the
      software is continuously refined and improved.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>4. Continuous Feedback</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Agile development emphasizes continuous feedback, which means that the development team is
      constantly receiving feedback from the customer and other stakeholders. This feedback helps to
      ensure that the software meets the needs of the customer.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>5. Agile Practices</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Agile development uses a number of practices to help facilitate collaboration, flexibility,
      and iterative development. These practices include user stories, sprints, daily stand-ups, and
      retrospectives.
