    <Paragraph>
      Scrum is a widely-used Agile methodology for software development. It is an iterative and
      incremental approach that emphasizes collaboration, self-organization, and continuous
      improvement. Scrum is based on the Agile Manifesto, and it is designed to be highly adaptable
      to changing requirements and priorities. In this article, we&apos;ll discuss the key
      components of Scrum, its benefits and drawbacks, and its applications. Here are the key
      components of Scrum:
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>1. Scrum Team</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The Scrum team is a self-organizing, cross-functional team that is responsible for developing
      the software. The team typically consists of a product owner, a Scrum master, and developers.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>2. Product Backlog</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The product backlog is a prioritized list of requirements for the software. The product owner
      is responsible for managing the product backlog and ensuring that it is up-to-date.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>3. Sprint</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      A sprint is a time-boxed period of development that typically lasts two to four weeks. During
      a sprint, the Scrum team works to develop a potentially shippable increment of the software.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>4. Sprint Planning</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      At the beginning of each sprint, the Scrum team holds a sprint planning meeting. During this

    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>5. Daily Scrum</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      During the sprint, the Scrum team holds a daily Scrum meeting. During this meeting, the team
      members discuss their progress, any issues they are facing, and what they will work on next.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>6. Sprint Review</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      At the end of each sprint, the Scrum team holds a sprint review meeting. During this meeting,
      the team demonstrates the work they completed during the sprint.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>7. Sprint Retrospective</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      After the sprint review, the Scrum team holds a sprint retrospective meeting. During this
      meeting, the team reflects on what went well during the sprint and what they can improve for
      the next sprint.
