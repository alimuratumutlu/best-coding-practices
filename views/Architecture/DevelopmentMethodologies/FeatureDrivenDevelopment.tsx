    <Paragraph>
      Feature Driven Development (FDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes a
      structured and iterative approach to development. It was created by Jeff De Luca in the late
      1990s and is based on a set of best practices and principles.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In FDD, development is divided into a series of short iterations, each of which focuses on a
      specific feature of the system being developed. These features are identified and prioritized
      based on their business value, and development proceeds in a disciplined and structured
      manner.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      FDD emphasizes domain modeling and design, and includes techniques for creating and
      maintaining a feature list, developing an overall model of the system, and creating and
      tracking detailed design documents. It also includes techniques for code inspection and
      reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      FDD emphasizes teamwork and collaboration, with a focus on empowering team members to take
      ownership of their work and contribute to the success of the project. It also includes a
      strong emphasis on measurement and progress tracking, with regular status reports and progress
      reviews.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      FDD is often used in conjunction with other methodologies, such as Agile, and can be adapted
      to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It is particularly well-suited for large
      and complex projects with a significant focus on domain modeling and design.
