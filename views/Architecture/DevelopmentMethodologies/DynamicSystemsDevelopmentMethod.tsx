    <Paragraph>
      Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an Agile software development methodology that
      emphasizes iterative and incremental development, collaboration, and user involvement. It was
      created by the DSDM Consortium in the 1990s and is based on a set of best practices and
      principles.

    <Paragraph>
      DSDM emphasizes active user involvement throughout the development process, with a focus on
      frequent feedback and collaboration. It includes techniques for defining and prioritizing
      requirements, creating a time-boxed plan, and delivering small increments of functionality in
      a rapid and iterative manner.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      DSDM includes a strong emphasis on communication and collaboration, with a focus on empowering
      team members to take ownership of their work and contribute to the success of the project. It
      also includes techniques for identifying and addressing project risks, and for continuous
      improvement.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      DSDM is often used in conjunction with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Extreme
      Programming (XP), and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It
      is particularly well-suited for projects with a significant focus on user involvement and
      collaboration, and for projects that require flexibility and adaptability.
