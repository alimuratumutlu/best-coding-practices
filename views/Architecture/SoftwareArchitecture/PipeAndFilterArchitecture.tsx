    <Paragraph>
      Pipe and filter architecture is an approach to building software systems where the application
      is divided into a set of components, each responsible for a specific task or function, and the
      data flows through a set of interconnected filters in a pipeline-like structure.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In a pipe and filter architecture, each component (or filter) receives input data from a
      previous filter, performs a specific operation on the data, and outputs the transformed data
      to the next filter in the pipeline. This allows for a high degree of modularity and
      reusability, as filters can be combined and reused in different configurations.

    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Scalability: "
      itemDescription="Pipe and filter architecture can be highly scalable, as filters can be added or removed from the pipeline dynamically to handle changes in the workload."

    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Flexibility: "
      itemDescription="Pipe and filter architecture allows for a wide range of applications, from simple data processing to complex analytics and data transformation."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Complexity management: "
      itemDescription="Pipe and filter architecture can help manage complexity by breaking down the application into smaller, more manageable components."
    />

    <Paragraph>
      Overall, pipe and filter architecture is a flexible and scalable approach to building software
      systems, with a focus on modularity, reusability, and flexibility. It is well-suited for
      applications that involve data processing, transformation, or analytics, such as image
      processing, audio or video processing, and data mining.
