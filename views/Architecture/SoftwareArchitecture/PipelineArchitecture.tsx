      Pipeline architecture is an approach to building software systems that involves breaking down
      complex processes into a series of smaller, more manageable steps or stages, and executing
      these steps in sequence, often in parallel. Each stage in the pipeline is responsible for
      performing a specific task or operation, and the output of one stage becomes the input of the
      next stage, forming a continuous flow or pipeline of data or events.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Pipeline architecture is commonly used in data processing and data analysis applications,
      where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly and efficiently. In a pipeline
      architecture, the stages in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, which can significantly
      improve processing speed and efficiency.

      itemLabel="🥚 Scalability: "
      itemDescription="The pipeline should be designed to handle increasing data volumes and processing demands, and to scale horizontally or vertically as needed."

    <Paragraph>
      Overall, pipeline architecture is a flexible and scalable approach to building software
      systems, with a focus on efficient data processing and analysis. It can be used in a wide
      range of applications, from data processing and analysis to machine learning, and can be
      adapted to suit a variety of use cases and requirements.
