    <Paragraph>
      Cloud architecture refers to the design and implementation of software systems that are
      deployed and run in the cloud. In recent years, the adoption of cloud computing has increased
      rapidly, and cloud architecture has become a crucial aspect of software architecture. Here are
      the key components of cloud architecture for software architecture:
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>1. Cloud Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Cloud infrastructure refers to the physical and virtual resources that are used to support
      cloud computing. Cloud infrastructure includes compute resources, such as virtual machines and
      containers, storage resources, such as object and block storage, and network resources, such
      as load balancers and virtual private networks (VPNs).
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>2. Cloud Services</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Cloud services refer to the pre-built services that are offered by cloud providers. Cloud
      services include compute services, such as serverless computing and container orchestration,
      storage services, such as databases and data warehouses, and network services, such as content
      delivery networks (CDNs) and domain name systems (DNS).
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>3. Cloud Platforms</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Cloud platforms refer to the pre-built platforms that are offered by cloud providers. Cloud
      platforms include application development platforms, such as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
      offerings, and data analytics platforms, such as Big Data and machine learning platforms.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>4. Cloud Security</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Cloud security refers to the set of practices, technologies, and policies that are used to
      protect cloud-based systems and data from cyber threats. Cloud security includes network
      security, data encryption, identity and access management (IAM), and compliance with
      regulatory requirements.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>5. Cloud Monitoring</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Cloud monitoring refers to the set of tools and techniques that are used to monitor and manage
      cloud-based systems and applications. Cloud monitoring includes performance monitoring, log
      analysis, and application monitoring.
