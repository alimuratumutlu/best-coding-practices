      Microkernel architecture is an architectural style that is used in software development to
      build software systems with a small core kernel that provides basic services, while additional
      services are implemented as independent modules that run in user space. The microkernel
      architecture separates the core services from the system-specific services, which results in a
      more flexible and maintainable system. Here are the key components of microkernel
      architecture:
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>1. Microkernel</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The microkernel is the core component of microkernel architecture. It provides basic services,
      such as process management, memory management, and interprocess communication. The microkernel
      is designed to be small, efficient, and reliable.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>2. Services</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Services are the additional components that provide additional functionality beyond the basic
      services provided by the microkernel. Services can be implemented as independent modules that
      run in user space. Services are designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>3. Drivers</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Drivers are the components that provide the interface between the hardware and the software.
      Drivers are designed to be independent modules that run in user space. Drivers are designed to
      be modular, scalable, and maintainable.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>4. Communication Protocols</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Communication protocols are used to enable communication between components in microkernel
      architecture. Communication protocols include message passing, remote procedure call (RPC),
      and other protocols. Communication protocols ensure that components can communicate with each
      other in a standardized and efficient way.
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionTitle>5. Security</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Security is an essential component of microkernel architecture. Security includes
      authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Security ensures that the software system
      is secure and protected against cyber threats.
