    <Paragraph>
      Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development methodology that
      emphasizes automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and delivering
      software. It is based on a set of best practices and principles that aim to reduce errors,
      increase efficiency, and improve the speed of software delivery.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In CI/CD, the process begins with the integration of code changes into a shared repository.
      This integration triggers a series of automated tests and builds, which verify that the code
      changes are functional and do not introduce errors. The process then moves to continuous
      delivery, where the software is built, tested, and packaged in a repeatable and automated
      manner. Finally, the software is deployed to production, either manually or automatically.

    <Paragraph>
      CI/CD emphasizes a high degree of automation, with a focus on creating a repeatable and
      reliable process for building, testing, and delivering software. It includes techniques for
      creating automated tests, building and deploying software in a repeatable and consistent
      manner, and for continuously monitoring the system to identify and address issues and errors.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      CI/CD is often used in conjunction with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Extreme
      Programming (XP), and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It
      is particularly well-suited for projects with a significant focus on automation, efficiency,
      and reliability, or for projects where the speed of software delivery is critical to the
      success of the project. However, it may require a significant investment in time and resources
      to implement effectively.
