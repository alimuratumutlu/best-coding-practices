      Lean Development is a software development methodology that emphasizes reducing waste,
      increasing efficiency, and maximizing value. It is based on the principles of Lean
      Manufacturing and was adapted for software development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck.

    <Paragraph>
      In Lean Development, the focus is on identifying and eliminating waste in the development
      process. Waste can take many forms, including overproduction, waiting, defects, and
      over-processing, among others. By eliminating waste, Lean Development aims to increase
      efficiency and reduce costs.

    <Paragraph>
      Lean Development also emphasizes delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible. It
      includes techniques for identifying and prioritizing customer needs, creating a continuous
      flow of work, and delivering small increments of functionality in a rapid and iterative
      manner.

    <Paragraph>
      Lean Development emphasizes a culture of continuous improvement, with a focus on identifying
      and addressing problems as they arise. It includes techniques for visualizing work, measuring
      progress, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

    <Paragraph>
      Lean Development is often used in conjunction with other methodologies, such as Agile, and can
      be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It is particularly
      well-suited for projects with a focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and customer value.
