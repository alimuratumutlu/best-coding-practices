    <Paragraph>
      Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes creating a
      rich and expressive domain model as the basis for the development of complex systems. It was
      introduced by Eric Evans in the early 2000s.

    <Paragraph>
      In DDD, the process begins with identifying the core business concepts and processes, and
      creating a rich and expressive domain model that represents them. The development process then
      focuses on implementing this model in software, with a focus on ensuring that the model is
      closely aligned with the business requirements and that the software is highly maintainable
      and adaptable.

    <Paragraph>
      DDD emphasizes a high degree of collaboration and communication between developers, domain
      experts, and stakeholders, with a focus on ensuring that all parties have a shared
      understanding of the domain and the requirements of the system. It includes techniques for
      modeling the domain, creating a ubiquitous language, and creating and maintaining a highly
      maintainable and adaptable codebase.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      DDD is often used in conjunction with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Extreme
      Programming (XP), and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It
      is particularly well-suited for projects with a significant focus on complexity and business
      requirements, or for projects where the development of a rich and expressive domain model is
      critical to the success of the project. However, it may require a significant investment in
      time and resources to implement effectively.
