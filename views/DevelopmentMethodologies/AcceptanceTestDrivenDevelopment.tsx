    <Paragraph>
      Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a software development methodology that
      emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define and
      deliver software that meets the needs of the business. It is a variation of Test Driven
      Development (TDD) that focuses on creating automated acceptance tests before writing the code.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In ATDD, the process begins with defining the acceptance criteria for the system in terms of
      business requirements and user stories. These criteria are then translated into executable
      acceptance tests, which serve as the basis for testing and development. The development
      process focuses on delivering software that meets these acceptance tests and behaves as
      expected in response to different inputs and scenarios.

    <Paragraph>
      ATDD emphasizes collaboration and communication between developers, testers, and business
      stakeholders, with a focus on ensuring that all parties have a shared understanding of the
      desired behavior of the system. It includes techniques for defining acceptance criteria and
      tests, as well as for creating and maintaining automated tests.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      ATDD is often used in conjunction with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Extreme
      Programming (XP), and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It
      is particularly well-suited for projects with a significant focus on collaboration,
      communication, and alignment between business and development teams, or for projects where the
      requirements may change frequently. However, it may require a significant investment in time
      and resources to implement effectively.
