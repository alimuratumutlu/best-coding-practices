    <Paragraph>
      Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes
      rapid prototyping, iterative development, and quick delivery of working software. It was first
      introduced in the 1980s by James Martin.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      RAD emphasizes a high degree of user involvement and feedback, with a focus on understanding
      user needs and requirements and delivering software that meets those needs as quickly as
      possible. It includes techniques for rapid prototyping and iterative development, with a focus
      on delivering working software in short timeframes.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      RAD emphasizes a collaborative and flexible approach to development, with a focus on enabling
      cross-functional teams to work together effectively. It includes techniques for rapid
      application design, development, and testing, and for continuous integration and delivery.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      RAD is often used in conjunction with other methodologies, such as Agile, and can be adapted
      to suit the specific needs of a team or organization. It is particularly well-suited for
      projects with a significant focus on speed, user involvement, and flexibility. However, it may
      not be suitable for large and complex projects or projects with a high degree of technical
      complexity.
