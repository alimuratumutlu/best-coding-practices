    <Paragraph>
      Kanban is a software development methodology that emphasizes the visualization and management
      of work in progress. It originated in manufacturing and was later adapted for software
      development by David Anderson.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In Kanban, work is visualized on a board that consists of columns representing the various
      stages of the development process. Each piece of work, or &quot;card,&quot; is represented by
      a sticky note or a digital equivalent and is moved from one column to the next as it
      progresses through the process.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Kanban emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) to prevent bottlenecks and overburdening
      team members. By visualizing the flow of work and limiting WIP, Kanban can help teams identify
      and address inefficiencies in their processes.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Kanban is often used in conjunction with other methodologies, such as Agile or Lean, and can
      be adapted to suit the specific needs of a team or organization.
