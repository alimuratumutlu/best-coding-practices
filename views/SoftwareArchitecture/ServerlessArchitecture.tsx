    <Paragraph>
      Serverless architecture is an approach to building software systems where the responsibility
      for infrastructure management and maintenance is shifted to the cloud provider, freeing
      developers from the need to manage servers and infrastructure. In a serverless architecture,
      applications are broken down into smaller, independent functions, and these functions are
      executed by cloud-based serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google
      Cloud Functions.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In a serverless architecture, developers write and deploy functions, and the cloud provider
      takes care of provisioning, scaling, and managing the underlying infrastructure needed to
      execute those functions. This means that developers can focus on writing code and building
      features, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Serverless architecture is well-suited for applications that require high scalability and high
      availability, such as real-time data processing and analytics. It is also well-suited for
      applications that require frequent updates and changes, such as web applications and
      microservices.

    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Function-based programming: "
      itemDescription="Applications are broken down into smaller, independent functions."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Event-driven processing: "
      itemDescription="Functions are triggered by events, such as a user uploading a file or a new message arriving in a queue, rather than being invoked directly."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Microservices: "
      itemDescription="Functions can be organized into microservices, with each function performing a specific task or set of tasks."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Automatic scaling: "
      itemDescription="Serverless platforms can automatically scale functions up or down based on demand, ensuring that there is always enough capacity to handle incoming requests."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Pay-per-use pricing: "
      itemDescription="Serverless platforms typically charge based on the number of function executions and the amount of resources used, making it a cost-effective approach to building software systems."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Third-party integration: "
      itemDescription="Functions can be easily integrated with third-party services, such as databases, messaging services, or analytics tools."
    />
    <Paragraph>
      Overall, serverless architecture is a highly scalable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance
      approach to building software systems, with a focus on rapid development and flexibility. It
      is well-suited for applications with unpredictable or fluctuating workloads, such as web and
      mobile applications, or IoT devices.
