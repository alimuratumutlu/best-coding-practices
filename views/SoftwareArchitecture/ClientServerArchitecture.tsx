    <Paragraph>
      Client-server architecture is an approach to building software systems that divides the
      application into two main parts: the client, which is the user-facing component, and the
      server, which is responsible for processing requests and storing and managing data. The client
      and server communicate with each other over a network, using standardized protocols such as
      HTTP, TCP/IP, or WebSocket.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In a client-server architecture, the client typically runs on a user&apos;s device, such as a
      desktop computer or a mobile device, and provides the user interface and user experience. The
      server runs on a separate machine, often in the cloud, and is responsible for processing
      requests, storing data, and executing business logic.

    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Separation of concerns: "
      itemDescription="The client and server are designed to handle different aspects of the application, with the client responsible for user interaction and the server responsible for processing and storing data."

    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Standardized protocols: "
      itemDescription="Client-server communication uses standardized protocols to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different components and systems."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Scalability: "
      itemDescription="Client-server architecture can be scaled horizontally, by adding more servers to handle increased load, or vertically, by increasing the processing power and memory of existing servers."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Security: "
      itemDescription="Client-server architecture can use encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms to ensure that data is secure and only authorized users have access to it."
    />
    <ListItem
      itemLabel="Flexibility: "
      itemDescription="Client-server architecture allows for a wide range of applications, from simple client-server interactions to complex multi-tiered systems."
    />
    <Paragraph>
      Overall, client-server architecture is a widely used approach to building software systems,
      with a focus on scalability, flexibility, and separation of concerns. It is well-suited for a
      wide range of applications, from simple websites to complex enterprise systems.
