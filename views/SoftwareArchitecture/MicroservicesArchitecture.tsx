    <Paragraph>
      Microservices architecture is an architectural style that is used to build software systems as
      a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.
      Each service is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, and each service is
      developed, deployed, and managed independently. Microservices architecture enables developers
      to create software systems that are highly scalable, flexible, and maintainable. Here are the
      key components of microservices architecture:
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>1. Services</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Services are the building blocks of microservices architecture. Each service is designed to
      perform a specific task or set of tasks. Services are developed, deployed, and managed
      independently. Services communicate with each other through APIs.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>2. API Gateway</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The API gateway is the component that sits between the client and the services. The API
      gateway is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate service and for managing
      security, caching, and load balancing.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>3. Service Registry</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The service registry is the component that maintains a list of available services and their
      locations. The service registry enables services to discover each other and to communicate
      with each other.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>4. Configuration Server</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      The configuration server is the component that stores configuration information for the
      services. The configuration server enables services to be configured dynamically, without the
      need for manual intervention.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>5. Monitoring and Logging</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Monitoring and logging are essential components of microservices architecture. Monitoring
      enables developers to monitor the health of the system and to detect issues before they become
      critical. Logging enables developers to diagnose and fix issues quickly.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>6. Security</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Security is an essential component of microservices architecture. Security includes
      authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Security ensures that the software system
      is secure and protected against cyber threats.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>7. Containerization</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Containerization is an essential component of microservices architecture. Containerization
      enables services to be packaged and deployed as containers. Containerization ensures that
      services can be deployed and managed easily and efficiently.
    </Paragraph>
    <SectionTitle>8. Infrastructure</SectionTitle>
    <Paragraph>
      Infrastructure is an essential component of microservices architecture. Infrastructure
      includes the hardware and software required to run the services. Infrastructure ensures that
      the software system can be deployed and managed efficiently.
