    <Paragraph>
      Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle in software engineering that promotes the
      separation of a system&apos;s functionality into distinct, independent components or modules,
      each responsible for a specific concern or aspect of the system&apos;s behavior. The principle
      is intended to increase the modularity, maintainability, and scalability of software systems,
      and to reduce the complexity and coupling between components.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The idea behind SoC is that by separating concerns, the functionality of a system can be more
      easily understood, modified, and tested. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect
      of the system&apos;s behavior, and is designed to operate independently of other components,
      with well-defined interfaces for communication and interaction.

    <Paragraph>
      For example, in a web application, the user interface and business logic might be separated
      into separate modules. The user interface would be responsible for displaying information to
      the user, collecting input, and sending requests to the server, while the business logic would
      be responsible for processing requests, managing data, and enforcing business rules. By
      separating these concerns, each module can be developed and tested independently, and changes
      to one module will have minimal impact on the other module.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Overall, SoC is an important principle for building high-quality software that is easy to
      understand, modify, and test. By separating concerns into independent modules, developers can
      build systems that are more modular, maintainable, and scalable, and that can be adapted to
      changing requirements and environments over time.
