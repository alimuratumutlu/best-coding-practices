      <Paragraph>
        Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. They provide
        a way to organize and store data in a way that makes it easier to access, manipulate, and
        process. There are many different types of data structures, each with its own strengths and
        weaknesses, and each designed to solve specific problems.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In general, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be
        accessed and used efficiently. The choice of data structure depends on the specific problem
        that needs to be solved, as well as the constraints and requirements of the system.

      <SectionTitle>Types of Data Structures</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        There are many different types of data structures, but here are some of the most commonly
        used ones:
      </Paragraph>
      <SectionTitle>Arrays</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays are
        typically used to store data of the same type, such as a list of numbers or a list of
        strings. Arrays are a simple and efficient data structure, but they can be limited in their
        flexibility, as their size is fixed when they are created.

      <SectionTitle>Linked Lists</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A linked list is a collection of elements, each containing a value and a pointer to the next
        element in the list. Linked lists are used to store data of any type and can be easily
        modified by adding or removing elements. However, accessing an element in a linked list
        requires traversing the list from the beginning, which can be time-consuming.

      <SectionTitle>Stacks</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements
        are added to and removed from the top of the stack, and the most recently added element is
        always the first to be removed. Stacks are used to keep track of function calls, undo and
        redo operations, and other similar tasks.

      <SectionTitle>Queues</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements
        are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front, and the oldest element is
        always the first to be removed. Queues are used to manage tasks in a system, such as
        printing jobs or network requests.

      <SectionTitle>Trees</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node
        contains a value, and the edges define the relationship between the nodes. Trees are used to
        represent hierarchical relationships, such as the structure of a file system or the
        organization of a company.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Let&apos;s create a simple file system hierarchy as a tree using JavaScript. We can
        represent each directory as a node in the tree, with its children directories and files as
        its edges.

      <SectionTitle>Graphs</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A graph is a collection of nodes and edges that can be connected in any way. Graphs are used
        to represent complex relationships between elements, such as social networks, road networks,
        and communication networks.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Let&apos;s create a simple social network as a graph using JavaScript. We can represent each
        user as a node in the graph, with their connections to other users as its edges.
      </Paragraph>
      <Gist id="f37f4db982c156279c2fe81b30ac87a3" />
      <Paragraph>
        In this example, we create a Node class that represents each user in the social network. We
        create three users, user1, user2, and user3, and connect them to each other using the
        addConnection method. We represent the connections between users as edges in the graph.
